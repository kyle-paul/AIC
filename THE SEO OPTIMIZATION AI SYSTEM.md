# THE SEO OPTIMIZATION AI SYSTEM

## Overview
1. Uniqueness: 
1. Time-saving (package all things in one step)  --> Training NLP combined with Large Language Model
2. Ensure 0% plagirism and 100% uniqness
3. Optimizing both on-page (keywords generation, description, title, headings) and off-page (metadata, links, urls, domains, Alt tags in images)
4. Automatic image generation with optimized alt / Image analysis for automated Alt tagging --> Training CNN model
5. Record and assess the ranking, links traffics 

2. Others can not do:
1. Combine into a end-to-end process
2. Can not ensure plagirism 100% since the whole document is not from them 
3. No off-pagee optimization like image alt tagging or meta data optimization
